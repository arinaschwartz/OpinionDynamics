HW1: Opinion Dynamics

Sept 2011

Here are some things to think about when writing your solution.

Have you put your name(s) at the top of the file Opinion.java?

update function: Does your code

  * compute the lead and partner correctly for both
    interior and boundary elements (that is, 0 & n-1),

  * handle the case where the lead and partner have different opinions
    properly, and

  * choose the voter to update when the lead and partner have the same 
    opinion properly?

doStep function: Does your code

  * make N calls to update and

  * randomly choose the element to update?


hasConverged: Does your code 

  * handle the case where all the elements are the same properly,

  * handle the case where the elements are not all the same properly, and

  * handle the boundary cases where element 0 (or element n-1) is different
    from the rest of the elements?


doOneSimulation: Does your code

  * stop making calls to doStep once the voters have converged on an opinion and
 
  * does it stop making calls to doStep after MAX_STEP steps,

  * return the number of steps executed, and

  * complete at least one step?


estimateExitProbability: Does your code

  * generate a new set of voters for each trial,

  * test whether a given trial converged to A properly, and

  * compute the return percentage of successful trials properly?
    (Recall that you will want to use floating point (double) division
    rather than integer division)
